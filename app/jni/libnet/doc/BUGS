    1.1.0 KNOWN BUG LIST
 
    - It appears as though getprotobynumber() is broken in some linux
      distributions.  The /etc/protocols file should be of the format:
      protocol name protocol number proctocol symbolic constant comment
      Most of the file (in my redhat 7.1) distro complies with this format
      until you get to the end of the file:
      #       134-254                 # Unassigned  
      #       255                     # Reserved
      This will cause getprotobynumber() and presumably getprotobyname() to
      segfault.  If you get this behavior in your program and you're calling
      __libnet_file_dump(), this could be the reason.  Caveat Emptor.
